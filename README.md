# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use unsupervised machine learning to help discover information about cryptocurrencies, that can be the backbone of a cryptocurrency investment portfolio offered by Accountability Accounting. 

### Programs
Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook </br>

## Summary
With an initial list of over 1000 cryptocurrencies, processing the data resulted in only 532 that had complete information and could be run in a machine learning environment. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the dataset was scaled down to 3 principal components, an elbow curve was then used to determine that the optimal K-value for the machine learning algorithm is 4. A 3D-cluster plot was run for the components to show the 4 clusters, and a plot showing Total Coin Supply and Total Coins Mined.
